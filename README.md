My Game Framework
=================

This repository is mainly intended for myself to keep a current and relatively
clean version of the stuff I commonly copy around and use in various game
projects.

This is *not* intended to be a generic game framework that anyone can pick up
and start using with ease. Anyone reading this can feel free to use this if
they wish, but I make no guarantees about this working well for you.

This framework includes:

* non-game-specific source code
* supporting assets (basic UI skin, fonts, shaders, etc)
* build scripts

This stuff is all in a constant state of flux and I'll be trying to copy the
changes and improvements I make to this framework during the development of my
other game projects back to this repository to keep it up to date.
